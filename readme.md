# Organization

The project is made up of two projects.  The project in canvas/ holds algorithms
for generating images using canvas.  Example if you will.  At the moment each
drawing is a work in progress.

The project in vec/ holds the library used to generate the drawings using a
canvas context.

# Setup

```
%> cd path-to-project
%> cd vec; npm install
%> cd ../canvas; npm install
%> ./run.sh
```

The final command runs the file watch/main.js
